			<h2>About</h2> 
				<p>The Enterprise Career Portal is a project written by James Hare.</br>
				In this project, I wanted to stretch my skills in both web based development</br>
				and database management.</p>
				</br>
				<p>The primary features that I wanted to include was a way for users to create a new</br>
				account, login using a password, post a job, search for jobs, apply to jobs and view</br>
				applicants for a job</p>
				</br>
				<p>The database is hosted on a local LAMP server and cannot be accessed over</br>
				the Internet for security reasons.</p>
